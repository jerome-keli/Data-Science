Linear Regression Practical Example

This repository demonstrates a practical application of linear regression for a targeted variable. This dataset is about cars and the factors(independent variables) that could potentially affect the price(dependent variable). The provided Notebook  guides you through the steps of building and evaluating a linear regression model.

This notebook includes:

Importing essential libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.\
Loading and exploring a sample dataset.\
Preparing data for modeling (handling missing values, feature scaling).\
Splitting data into training and testing sets.\
Fitting a linear regression model.\
Evaluating model performance using metrics like R-squared and mean squared error.\
Making predictions on new data.
